          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Healthcare</h2>
          <p>Based on the sample data, there is a significant correlation between poverty and inadequet access to healthcare.  The causes of poor health for millions globally are rooted in political, social and economic injustices. Poverty increases the chances of poor health. </p>

          <p> Poverty's harsh effects on health starts before a baby is born and piles up throughout their adult life. With stressed-filled homes, shaky nutrition, toxic environments and health-care gaps of every kind, kids in very low-income families may never catch up when it comes to their health. </p>
          
          <p>Variations between states in the inequality of the distribution of income can be significantly associated with variations between states in a large number of health outcomes. These differences parallel relative investments in human and social capital. Economic policies that influence income and wealth inequality may have an important impact on a persons health.</p>
